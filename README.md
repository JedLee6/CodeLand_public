Code Land is a programming software for children and teenagers of different ages from 3 to 16 based on Google's visual graphics programming language Blockly. Children and teenagers can not only drag and drop Blockly code block in the APP, and train their programming thinking in the form of block assembly such as word recognition and puzzle game, but also learn programming, algorithm and develop their own program with Blockly code block, so that every child can create the future with code.
The APP has the following two modules:

### 1.1 The programming game module

This module is designed to help children develop their intelligence between the ages of 7 and 13.This module has 5 to 6 puzzle game scenes, such as maze, drawing, etc. In the level, children can use "code" to pass the levels in the game scene, and improve their logical thinking ability while reaping the fun of the game.
